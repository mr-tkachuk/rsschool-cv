## About Me
My main goal is to receive a job-offer to frontend developer and change my life (I work in HoReCa.)   
I love reading and walking, but most of all I prefer gaming at my free time. I love spiders, so I have very big one.

## My skills
* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript
* Git, Github
* SQL
* VSCode

## Code Example

**Can we divide it? KATA from codewars:** *Your task is to create the functionIsDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by both integers a and b.*
``` javascript
function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
  let result = true;
  if ((number % a != 0) ||(number % b != 0))
    result = false;
  return result;
}
```
